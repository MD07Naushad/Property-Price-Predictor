# Property-Price-Predictor
•  Working on a machine learning based project
•  In this project I’ve gone through analyzing the problem by collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values, and much more. In the end, I present the problem to the Imaginary real estate company which will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features.
